# This is the script handler of the BeatNet. First, it extracts the input embeddings of the current frame or the whole song, depending on the working mode. 
# Then by feeding them into the selected pre-trained model, it calculates the beat/downbeat activation probabilities.
# Finally, it infers beats and downbeats of the current frame/song based on one of the four performance modes and selected inference method.

class BeatNet:

    '''
    The main BeatNet handler class including different trained models, different modes for extracting the activation and causal and non-causal inferences

        Parameters
        ----------
        Inputs: 
            model: An scalar in the range [1,3] to select which pre-trained CRNN models to utilize. 
            mode: An string to determine the working mode. i.e. 'stream', 'realtime', 'online' and ''offline.
                'stream' mode: Uses the system microphone to capture sound and does the process in real-time. Due to training the model on standard mastered songs, it is highly recommended to make sure the microphone sound is as loud as possible. Less reverbrations leads to the better results.  
                'Realtime' mode: Reads an audio file chunk by chunk, and processes each chunck at the time.
                'Online' mode: Reads the whole audio and feeds it into the BeatNet CRNN at the same time and then infers the parameters on interest using particle filtering.
                'offline' mode: Reads the whole audio and feeds it into the BeatNet CRNN at the same time and then inferes the parameters on interest using madmom dynamic Bayesian network. This method is quicker that madmom beat/downbeat tracking.
            inference model: A string to choose the inference approach. i.e. 'PF' standing for Particle Filtering for causal inferences and 'DBN' standing for Dynamic Bayesian Network for non-causal usages.
            plot: A list of strings to plot. 
                'activations': Plots the neural network activations for beats and downbeats of each time frame. 
                'beat_particles': Plots beat/tempo tracking state space and current particle states at each time frame.
                'downbeat_particles': Plots the downbeat/meter tracking state space and current particle states at each time frame.
                Note that to speedup plotting the figures, rather than new plots per frame, the previous plots get updated. However, to secure realtime results, it is recommended to not plot or have as less number of plots as possible at the time.   
            threading: To decide whether accomplish the inference at the main thread or another thread. 
            device: type of dvice. cpu or cuda:i

        Outputs:
            A vector including beat times and downbeat identifier columns, respectively with the following shape: numpy_array(num_beats, 2).
